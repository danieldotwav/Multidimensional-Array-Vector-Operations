# Multidimensional-Array-Vector-Operations
This C++ program illustrates various operations on a multidimensional array and a vector, showcasing fundamental concepts in C++ programming. It demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming, class design, and array/vector manipulation.

## **Key Features:**

### Class Implementation: 
The program features a class named stuGrade, encapsulating functionality for initializing arrays, vectors, and performing operations on them.

### Array and Vector Initialization: 
It demonstrates how to initialize a two-dimensional array (proj1) and a two-dimensional vector (vec) with data.

### Vector Manipulation: 
The program includes a function to replace specific elements in a vector (replace function) and displays the updated vector.

### Sorting: 
It sorts the elements of the multidimensional array (proj1) in ascending order using the C++ standard library's sort function.

### Average Calculation: 
The program calculates the average of each row in the multidimensional array and stores the results in an array (avgR).

### Code Organization: 
The code is well-structured, with distinct class methods for various operations, enhancing readability and maintainability.

Explore this program to understand how to work with multidimensional data structures, apply object-oriented principles, and perform common array and vector operations in C++.
